# Figures

This folder contains output figures generated by the analysis scripts in `../scripts/`.  
Each file corresponds to a panel or subpanel in the manuscript. File names are numbered to match the analysis order.

## Contents

  Sensitivity/resistance proportions summarized by OBC presence/absence.

- `03_plant_health_OBC.pdf`  
  Green pixel quantification (plant health) compared between OBC-present and OBC-absent strains.

- `04_tnseq_scatter.pdf`  
  Scatterplot of TnSeq-derived plant fitness phenotypes.

- `05_geneplot.pdf`  
  Gene map of the focal OBC cluster, colored by TnSeq results.
