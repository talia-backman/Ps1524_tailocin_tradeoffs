# Figures

This folder contains output figures generated by the analysis scripts in `../scripts/`.  
Each file corresponds to a panel or subpanel in the manuscript. File names are numbered to match the analysis order.

## Contents

- `01_tailocin_killing_matrix.pdf`  
  Killing matrix heatmap with phylogenetic tree and HTF-length annotations.

- `02_HTF_OBC_sensitivity_summary.pdf`  
  Sensitivity/resistance proportions summarized by OBC presence/absence.

- `03_plant_health_OBC.pdf`  
  Green pixel quantification (plant health) compared between OBC-present and OBC-absent strains.

- `04_tnseq_scatter.pdf`  
  Scatterplot of TnSeq-derived plant fitness phenotypes.

- `05_geneplot.pdf`  
  Gene map of the focal OBC cluster, colored by TnSeq results.

- `06_plant_infections_luciferase.pdf`  
  Fold-change in bacterial luminescence at 7 dpi across strains and ecotypes.

- `07_plant_disease.pdf`  
  Stacked bar plots of plant outcomes (healthy vs diseased/dead) per strain and ecotype.

- `08_disease_vs_load.pdf`  
  Correlation between bacterial load (luminescence) and plant health (proportion healthy).

- `09_oxidative_stress.pdf`  
  Growth responses of WT and OPS mutants across H₂O₂ gradients.  
  Includes scaled-dose AUC profiles and mixed-model estimated marginal means (Fig. SX).

- `10_aggregation.pdf`  
  Proportion of wells exhibiting aggregation across strains.  
  All OPS mutants except ∆rmlC show strong aggregation, whereas WT and ∆rmlC do not (Fig. SX).

- `11_qPCR.pdf` *(placeholder)*  
  Planned figure showing differential expression of Arabidopsis immune marker genes following infection with WT vs O-antigen mutants.
