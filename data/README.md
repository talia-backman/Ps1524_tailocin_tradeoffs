# Data directory

This folder contains the input data for each analysis.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a figure panel in the manuscript:

- `01_tailocin_killing_matrix/` – killing matrix CSVs and phylogeny (Fig. 1A).  
- `02_HTF_OBC_sensitivity_summary/` – sensitivity assays, haplotype mapping (Fig. 1B).  
- `03_plant_health_OBC/` – pixel-based plant health quantification (Fig. 1C).  
- `04_tnseq_scatter/` – TnSeq-derived plant fitness values (Fig. 2B).  
- `05_geneplot/` – OBC cluster annotations (Fig. 2C).  
- `06_plant_infections/` – luciferase infection assay outputs (Fig. 3C).  
- `07_plant_disease/` – qualitative disease scoring and contamination metadata (Fig. 3D).  
- `08_disease_vs_load/` – (no raw data; generated by merging 06 + 07, Fig. 3E).  
- `09_oxidative_stress/` – raw and processed data for oxidative stress tolerance assays (Fig. SX).  
  - `input/` – OD₆₀₀ growth curves and plate layouts for R12–R16 H₂O₂ gradient experiments.  
  - `output/` – processed AUC-normalized data, WT MIC estimates (`WT_MIC_by_replicate.csv`), and emmeans contrasts vs WT (`emmeans_contrasts_vsWT_scaledMIC.csv`).
- `10_aggregation/` – aggregation phenotype scoring data from static culture assays (R1–R3, Fig. SX).  
  - `input/` – raw plate-level phenotype calls (`R1-R3_phenotype.csv`).  
  - `output/` – summary statistics including χ² and Fisher’s exact test results (`10_aggregation_stats.csv`).
- `11_qPCR/` – (future) qPCR datasets quantifying expression of Arabidopsis immune marker genes after infection with WT and O-antigen mutants (planned for Fig. SX).
